ArbitrageTradingMode is watching prices of the configured trading pairs across the available exchanges 
to find [arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp) opportunities.

ArbitrageTradingMode is watching the price of the traded pairs accord every exchange and computes its average price.
If the price of a pair is far enough from its average cross-exchange price, an arbitrage trade is initiated. 

An arbitrage trade consists in **2 orders**:
 1. A limit buy or sell at the current local exchange price
 2. When this first order is filled:
    - A limit buy or a sell at the average price (average of prices on other exchanges) is created to benefit from the arbitrage opportunity 
    - A stop loss on the opposite side is created to secure funds
    
The first limit order is cancelled if the local exchange price reaches the other exchanges average price.  
**No funds are transferred** from one exchange to another, it all happens on the same exchange.

It is recommended to enable arbitrage trading on **few exchanges only** to benefit from **price lag**: 
simply register these exchanges in your ArbitrageTradingMode configuration.  
**Every exchange** in your OctoBot configuration will be used to compute the **average price** for each traded pair, 
therefore you can add **highly liquid exchanges** to be used as **price references only** and quickly 
spot arbitrage opportunities.

By default **every exchange** in your OctoBot configuration is used for arbitrage trading. It is recommended to 
**narrow this list down** in your ArbitrageTradingMode configuration and **only trade on the ones offering 
arbitrage opportunities and use the others as price indicators**.

Exchanges that are used for **price reference only require no api keys** as no trade is performed on these exchanges.
