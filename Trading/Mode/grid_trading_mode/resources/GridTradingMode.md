Places a fixed amount of buy and sell orders at fixed intervals to profit from any market move. When an order is filled,
a mirror order is instantly created and generates profit when completed.

For each pair to trade, enter the interval between each order, the number of initial orders to 
create and you are ready to go.

Profits will be made from price movements within the covered price area.  
It never "sells at a loss", but always at a profit, therefore OctoBot never cancels any orders when using the Grid Trading Mode.

To apply changes to the Grid Trading Mode settings, you will have to manually cancel orders and restart your OctoBot.  
This trading mode instantly places opposite side orders when an order is filled.  

Only works with independent bases and quotes : ETH/USDT and ADA/BTC can be activated together but ETH/USDT
and BTC/USDT can't be activated together for the same OctoBot instance since they are sharing the same symbol 
(here USDT).
