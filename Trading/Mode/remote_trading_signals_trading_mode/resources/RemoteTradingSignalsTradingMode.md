RemoteTradingSignalsTradingMode trades using signals from community strategies you are subscribed to.

Note: by default, if you don't meet the minimal exchange requirements for order size, 
the smallest possible order size will be used. This can be disabled in options.

_This trading mode supports PNL history when the signal emitter supports it as well._
